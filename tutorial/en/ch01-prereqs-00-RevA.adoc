== A JavaCC Tutorial
=== Introduction
image::1JavaCCprocess.png[Overview, float="right"]

Welcome to JavaCC (Java Compiler Compiler), a free open-source software tool that generates parsers. JavaCC reads thru your input text, commonly called a grammar (top box on right), and generates the appropriate Java code (second box). The code is compiled using the Java compiler (part of the JDK) and the resulting executable is used to parse grammatically correct text (bottom box on the right) and perform any actions that you have programmed into the parser.

Despite its name, JavaCC does not create a compiler; it generates the code for a parser (the front end of a compiler) which matches/recognizes the components of your target language. The compiler functionality (the backend) is outside the scope of what JavaCC can do (and outside of what will be covered in this tutorial). 

This tutorial will cover how to write grammars that JavaCC will read and use to generate Java code. It will not cover every possible feature or option because, well, it's an tutorial and not a college level text.

=== Tutorial Goals
This tutorial is meant to be an introduction to JavaCC and how parsers work. The goal is to teach you enough of the basics so that you can go on and develop the level of expertise that _you_ require.

The method used in this tutorial is to start with simple examples and then explore and develop step-by-step these examples to handle more cases and situations. If you find that some of the steps are too small or too obvious, go ahead and skip forward a couple of steps and see if it still makes sense. If it does, keep skipping forward until you find new material. After all, we've just met and I have no way of knowing what you know or don't know.

=== Tutorial Overview
The rest of this chapter will cover all the usual stuff: intended audience, conventions and setting up our computers for using JavaCC in a text window. Many of the computer setup details are pushed into Appendix A where separate sections will be dedicated to Linux setup, Windows setup, Mac setup and Raspberry Pi setup.

Chapter 2 will cover our first example where we will generate a parser for the "BarBaz" language. BarBaz is non-functional and nonsensical language whose only virtue is its extreme simplicity. BarBaz is the parser equivalent of the classic "hello world" program, which exists solely to demonstrate the simplest possible compilable program in many languages. We go into a lot of detail about the basics to make sure that you're following the right sequences and getting the right results.

Chapter 3 will cover Tokens and Regular Expressions by making soup. We will hit most of the basics of Tokens and Regular Expression so you will understand their behaviors and functions but you may have to do some googling if your specific needs weren't covered. There are places in these examples where production rules might be better solutions but rules are intentionally saved for later.

Chapter 4 will cover the basics of production rules, or more simply, rules. The structure of rules are covered as well as some of the streamlining that can be taken when defining or calling rules in JavaCC 21. Rule return values, rules parameters, and calling other rules are also covered. We'll also discuss the basics of the Abstract Syntax Tree and how we can use it within our grammars.

Chapter 5 will cover the latest features that are available in JavaCC 21 and how they can improve the grammars that you write and the code that is generated. Some of these features include code injection, lookahead, scan, scan to here, lookbehind and more.

Chapter 6 will cover TBD.

=== Audience
Broadly speaking, the audience for this tutorial can be divided into three groups:

. *Novice user.* You have little or no background in the parser generator space, either JavaCC or any other such tools.
. *Parser user.* Users with parser generator experience. Typically, you will have used https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yacc[Yacc] or https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Bison[Bison] or possibly https://antlr.org/[ANTLR], so the basic concepts are not new.
. *Legacy user.* Users of the https://javacc.org/[_legacy_ JavaCC tool]. You are familiar with the original JavaCC tool and want to learn about JavaCC 21 or upgrade to it.

This tutorial is written primarily for the first group, the novices, and will use a step-by-step approach to demonstrate the capabilities and functionality of JavaCC. 

However, there can easily be some overlap between the groups, such as an ANTLR user with some Legacy JavaCC experience, or a novice user who might have briefly dabbled in Yacc or Legacy JavaCC. So don't worry if you don't fit neatly into a single category; few of us ever do.

=== Conventions

Material appropriate for Parser users and Legacy users will be identified as such. So, for example, if I write:

NOTE: Information that is specific for certain groups, such as *Novice user*, *Parser user*, *Legacy user*, or *Windows user* will be labeled for the group it applies to. An example follows:

NOTE: *Windows user:* This tutorial is based on entering commands in a text window. A separate section is dedicated to possible Windows setup choices.

You can skip notes that don't apply to your group so you don't get bogged down in details that are more relevant to other users. However, if you're curious (always a good trait), go ahead and read the notes, but don't worry if they seem irrelevant or don't make sense - just keep plunging ahead with this tutorial.

Also, I might occasionally go off on a tangent and I'll mark it so that people who are in a hurry can skip over that.

*Tangent:* _Some information that is potentially useful (or failing that, amusing at least) but could easily be skipped if you are in a hurry._

As for people's background in the parser generator space, this is not a dry theoretical treatise and I am no theoretician anyway. It is a hands-on tutorial. However, certain theoretical concepts will be introduced as one goes through the tutorial. I will mark sections that introduce or discuss basic concepts so those with a good theoretical grounding in this space can glance thru or simply ignore.

All right, let's get started...

=== Toolset
This tutorial will assume a _lowest common denominator_ toolset. While this may require a little more typing on your part, it also will provide the most consistent behavior across platforms and software configurations, ensuring that your results will turn out as shown in this tutorial. This LCD toolset will require the following:

* You have JDK 1.8 or higher installed.
* You can type commands like `java` and `javac` on the command line.
* You have JavaCC 21 installed.
* You have a text editor that you are comfortable using to edit the various examples.

NOTE: I am not at all suggesting that this toolset (JDK + command line) is optimal. IDE's such as Eclipse and IntelliJ exist for a reason (for _many_ reasons) and so do modern build tools like Maven or Gradle. This tutorial takes this _lowest common denominator_ approach because its simplicity and predictability seems like the best way to demystify what is really going on.

=== Installing JavaCC 21
Using JavaCC 21 requires javacc-full.jar which contains all of the logic and functionality needed to process your grammar files and generate the appropriate java files. Download the latest JavaCC 21 from https://javacc.com/download/javacc-full.jar[here]. Using this link will place the jar file in your standard download location.

If you prefer to use the command line, change to an appropriate development directory and then type one of the following commands at your shell prompt:

 % curl -O https://javacc.com/download/javacc-full.jar
 
 % wget https://javacc.com/download/javacc-full.jar

These commands will download javacc-full.jar into your current directory. You will probably want to move the jar file someplace useful later on. Just remember where you put it (I always forget and then have to download it again).

=== Configuration Pre-Check

Let's start by seeing if your system is ready. Open a command window and at the prompt (% in this example), type:

 % java -version

It should respond with Java 1.8.x or greater. If it responds that java wasn't found, you'll either need to install a JDK or you'll need to fix the path to the JDK. Refer to Appendix A for installation information. But assuming that that last command worked:

 % javac -version

Again, it should respond with version 1.8.x or greater. If it didn't find javac, or if it displays an older (or mismatched) version, go to Appendix A for installation information. Once these commands succeed, continue with the next command.

In your command window, type:

 % java -jar javacc-full.jar 

A brief description of the jar usage and available options will be displayed. If Java complains about not finding the jar file or some other issue, fix those issues before continuing.

We're going to assume that you know how to launch your preferred text editor. Since most Linux distros have nano available by default, we will be using that for all examples and screenshots in this tutorial but you are welcome to use any plain text editor that you are comfortable with, even _shudder_ emacs (hat tip in admiration).

=== Streamlining the Process
TIP: Since you'll likely be typing the above command quite a bit as you go through the tutorial, I suggest that you create a shortcut to execute it, something like: 

    % alias jcc='java -jar javacc-full.jar'

This command assumes that the javacc-full.jar was downloaded into your current directory. If javacc-full.jar was downloaded into a standard download location instead, you may wish to move it to a different directory, such as ~/java/libs using the following command:

    % mv <download location>/javacc-full.jar ~/java/libs/javacc-full.jar

If you moved javacc-full.jar to ~/java/libs, your alias command would become:

    % alias jcc='java -jar ~/java/libs/javacc-full.jar'

It is also important that you include the quotes around everything after the equals sign.

Now you should be able to type `jcc` to invoke JavaCC. Well, try it:

    % jcc

You should get the javacc-full.jar message. In use, we'll follow `jcc` with the name of the grammar file that we want to have processed. 

TIP: The normal thing to do would be to add that above alias line to your shell configuration file, most likely `$HOME/.bashrc`

NOTE: *Windows Users* Refer to Appendix A for information on setting up DOS shortcuts.

=== Ready for Our First Example
