=== Breaking Down Our First Example
Let's look at the code that was generated. At the command line, open nano on the file `FirstParser.java`

Wow, 700+ lines! That's a lot of Java code to be generated from just one line in a grammar. But that's the secret to the power of JavaCC - one line in a grammar file can produce a thousand lines of Java code. But don't worry, we're not going to plow through all of those lines of generated code. Our goal right now is to understand how all these pieces fit together and understand how to use JavaCC. 

The following flowchart highlights the process that we completed so far.

This next flowchart shows more details about what happened when we processed our grammar file (First.javacc) thru JavaCC.

The big magic is really happening in the second step, when the grammar is processed by JavaCC. The following flowchart shows the highlights of when the grammar is processed.
