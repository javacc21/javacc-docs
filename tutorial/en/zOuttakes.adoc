......A huge number of text editors are available at every price point, from free to astronomically expensive. The choice is yours as long as it can produce plain unformatted text files and you find it _good enough_ to use. If you don't have a favorite text editor, it is suggested that you download and learn one of the free text editors that came with your OS distribution.

*Tangent:* For most Linux distributions, the _good enough_ text editor I refer to above is `nano`, not `vim`. `Vim` is usually installed on most Unix and Linux distributions, but unless you are already familiar with vim` (or its predecessor `vi`), it would be masochistic to use it for this tutorial!

//=== The Basic Approach (And I mean _Basic_)   SAVE THIS HEADING FOR LATER

For the rest of this tutorial, `nano` will be used simply because it is _good enough_. In the following screenshot of `nano`, we can see that it displays the text plainly and includes a brief menu of the most frequently used keyboard shortcuts and commands.

NOTE: It is likely that many readers (in particular, those who spend a lot of time on the command line) could skip the rest of this section and move on to the link:ch-0.html[first example - investigate why this link doesn't work in preview].

On Windows, not so much. You can, of course, go through the tutorial on a Windows machine, but:

* You understand that when I say something like: "Now you type `rm *.java` to delete the generated source files" this has to be `del *.java` on a default Windows command line.
* You use some sort of Unix shell on your Windows machine.
* Another perfectly reasonable possibility is that you remote login into a Unix machine and do the tutorial there -- the only prerequisite being, again, that the remote machine has a JDK installed.

IGNORE_CASE = true;   <<<<<Possible option at top of file that makes everything case insensitive >>>>>

Can also do:

TOKEN [IGNORE_CASE]: blah blah blah

to make just one token case insensitive but it may have some issues to make sure it only applies to just one token

And take a look at the acceptable values for the rest of the characters of an identifier (#PART_LETTER); it begins with ["\u0000"-"\u0008", "\u000e"-"\u001b", "$", . . . . . ].

TANGENT: 
Those are the ASCII control characters that I was always taught to never use because of the potential grief that these characters could cause - for example, ASCII 08 is the backspace character so there's no telling how your device will respond when it's told to backspace in the middle of an identifier. And ASCII 7f (127) is the Delete key value!! Does it print itself and then delete itself?

And wasn't the Base64 encoding developed to specifically to handle binary values, such as control characters, safely on the internet and prevent undesired side effects? Call me old fashioned, but I'd avoid control characters inside identifiers unless I had a really good reason for using them, even if it was legal. OK, lots of smarter people than me made this decision but I'd love to hear the logic for allowing these characters.

Chap 4 - Production Rules
Rules are in a gray area half-way between JavaCC and Java functions/methods. In the rules that we've seen so far, they have only matched Strings or Tokens but going forward we'll see that rules can execute other rules or Java code. Some authors of JavaCC grammars seem to use Tokens and rules almost exclusively; others mix in Java much more liberally. It depends on both the author and the text/language being parsed on the balance of Tokens, rules, and Java.

In JavaCC 21, many syntactical flourishes have been made optional and can be omitted. For example, _legacy JavaCC_  requires that every rule begin with the return type, which is frequently the void type meaning nothing is returned. So in JavaCC 21, the return type is only _required_ if it NOT void but will be accepted if provided. Similarly, if the rule isn't passed any parameters, the empty parentheses are NOT required but will be accepted if provided. So the following 4 rule declarations are equivalent:

    Foo :
    Foo() :
    void Foo :
    void Foo () :

Curly braces "{}" are also used a lot more in _Legacy JavaCC_ rules but can now be safely skipped because of the streamlining done in JavaCC 21. The following graphic outlines the optional items that can now be omitted:
