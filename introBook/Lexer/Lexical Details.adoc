=== Lexical Specifications Can Omit Curly Braces

(((Streamlined Syntax, Lexical Specifications))) (((Lexical Specifications, Streamlined Syntax)))
In this case, they are written with no opening { and the list is ended with a semicolon. Thus, instead of writing:
----
 TOKEN #Delimiter :
 {
    <LPAREN : "(">
    |
    <RPAREN> : ")">
    |
    <LBRACE> : "{">
    |
    <RBRACE> : "}">
 }
----

the newer, preferable syntax is:
----
 TOKEN #Delimiter :
  <LPAREN: "(" > 
  | 
  <RPAREN: ")" >
  | 
  <LBRACE: "{" > 
  |
  <RBRACE: "}" > 
 ;
----

IMPORTANT: If you omit the curly braces surrounding tokens, you _must_ use a semicolon to mark the end of each lexical specification (token production).

This format style is considered preferable, not because it saves much space (it doesn't!) but because one aspect of the newer syntax is that the {...} are reserved for elements that are really embedded Java actions. As you can see, in the newer syntax for BNF productions, the only use of {...} is for actual Java code.
