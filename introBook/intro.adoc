== Introduction

(((JavaCC 21, Introduction)))
The following document is a consolidation and distillation of the documentation written by Jonathan Revutsky, primary designer, coder, and documenter of JavaCC 21. 

The original JavaCC was originally developed in the late 1990's and released as open source in 2003. It has languished since its release as open source and has been slow to modernize. 

After submitting several update suggestions that were essentially ignored, Jon did what any good open source developer would do: he forked JavaCC and started updating the forked version. After several years of development, virtually every line in _legacy_ JavaCC has been replaced and the internal functionality of JavaCC has been reworked.

This document provides details about JavaCC 21, focusing on how to use its changes and new features. Many times the logic and reasoning for the changes are included so the need for the changes are understood.

This next image shows an overview of the files that are generated by JavaCC 21.

NOTE: After running the javac compiler against the files generated by JavaCC 21, it is normal to have more .class files than .java files because of inner classes, etc. These are not illustrated because they are generated by javac and not by JavaCC 21.
