|Option | Description | Comments

|-d <directory>
|Specify the directory (relative or absolute) for the generated files. If the directory doesn't exist, it will be created.
|*Example:* -d out   (Generated files are written into the "out" subdirectory of the grammar file directory.)

If this option is not set, the generated files are written into the same directory as the grammar file. 
|-jdkN
|Specify the target JDK version. N is a number from 8 to 18.
|If this is not set on the command line, the default version is 8. If this is set on the command line *AND* a different version is set at the top of the grammar (using JDK_TARGET option), the version specified on the command line is used.
|-n
|Suppress the check for a newer version
|The currently installed version of javacc-full.jar is used and may become stale over time.
|-p
|Define one or more comma-separated (no spaces) symbols to pass to the preprocessor.
|For example:   -p debug,strict
|-q
|Normal processing messages are not displayed. Error messages will still be displayed.
|JavaCC normally displays the name of each file as it is being generated. Using the -q option will suppress these messages, which can be useful when running JavaCC as part of a script.
|-lang <language>
|Specify the language to generate code in (the default is 'java')
|Valid choices are currently 'java', 'python' and 'csharp'
|===
// NOTE: the -d ../../src/generated  option doesn't work right - it creates src directory 2 levels up and ALSO creates src/generated directory 1 level up and puts generated files in there.
