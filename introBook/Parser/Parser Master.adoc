== The Parser

This chapter brings together information about the Parser, the component that processes the Tokens and literals identified by the Lexer. JavaCC uses the grammar file you specify to generate the Java code that you compile with javac which in turn is used to perform the production rules specified in the grammar file. The production rules are normally defined below the lexical rules that are normally defined at the top of the grammar.
