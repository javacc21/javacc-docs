== Things to Document

I'm starting this document just to maintain a list of various things that are not adequately documented anywhere. (Some of these things are alluded to here and there, maybe in a wiki page, or a blog post, but certainly not systematically documented.) So, eventually, we can just knock them off.

The list is not complete and I'll be adding things over time. But here are some glaring issues -- I mean, in terms of them not being documented. I'm pretty sure the stuff I describe below is all working, but it would be hard for anybody to know about it! (__If the tree falls in the forest but nobody hears it...__)

If our goal is to have systematic documentation that eventually stands alone as a book, then these are some things that we need to cover. (__Plenty of other things as well!__)

=== Strings that are aliased in a grammar file

There are some predefined strings that are actually __aliases__ in a JavaCC 21 grammar file, i.e. they are automatically substituted with something else in the generated code. For example, `PARSER_CLASS` and `LEXER_CLASS` can be used to refer to the name of the XXXParser class and XXXLexer class respectively. 

This is particularly useful if a grammar is liable to be used as an https://doku.javacc.com/doku.php?id=include[INCLUDE], since the code in an included grammarfile does not, generally speaking, "know" what the name of the parser or lexer classes are. Regardless, it is a good idea not to hard-code the names of the parser or lexer class all over the place, as it makes any code you write more easily reusable. So there are also the aliases: `CONSTANTS_CLASS`, `PARSER_PACKAGE`, and `NODE_PACKAGE` that exist for the same reason.


=== The hash symbol # in "semantic lookahead" and code actions to mark them as "global"

In __legacy__ JavaCC, a code action in the parsing is __only__ ever executed during parsing, __never__ in a lookahead.

However, the expression in a so-called __semantic__ lookahead is __always__ evaluated in legacy JavaCC, either in __parsing__ or in a __lookahead__. 

JavaCC 21 offers an extra layer of flexibility to this state of affairs. In JavaCC 21, you can add a `#` after a code action block OR a semantic lookahead to indicate that it __applies globally__ -- i.e. when parsing or scanning ahead.

The default behavior (without the `#` specified) is the same for code actions (__only__ when parsing, __not__ in lookahead) but is changed for semantic lookahead. In JavaCC 21, semantic lookahead is evaluated only when parsing, by default, and it becomes a __global__ semantic lookahead when you add the `#` after the closing brace `}`.

(N.B. A key __gotcha__ is that the code in a __global__ code action or a __global__ semantic lookahead cannot reference any local variables defined in the production. If you do that, your code will be generated without complaint, but then will not compile!)

=== Variables and methods that can be used your internal code.

The variables `lastConsumedToken` and `currentLookaheadToken` can be used in your various code actions, or in semantic lookahead, or in code that you https://doku.javacc.com/doku.php?id=code_injection_in_javacc_21[inject] into your `PARSER_CLASS`. The first one is simply the last token `consumed` by the parsing machinery. If you are in a lookahead routine, `currentLookaheadToken` is the last token the lookahead machinery scanned. If you are not in a lookahead routine, this variable is null.

The following method:

....
   Token getToken(int n)
....

looks ahead and returns the nth token in the token stream. This works in either parsing or in lookahead. A key point here is that: 

....
    getToken(0)
.... 

returns `lastConsumedToken` if you are parsing but if you are scanning ahead, it returns `currentLookaheadToken`. (This is quite useful when you are writing a global action or semantic lookahead that needs to work when parsing or scanning ahead.)

The following method:

....
    boolean isInProduction(String... name)
....

checks whether or not we have entered a given production. It works in either parsing or in lookahead. You can pass it a variable length list of String arguments, and it can check whether we have entered any of them. So you could have:

....
    if (isInProduction("ClassDeclaration", "InterfaceDeclaration")) {...}
....

to check whether we are currently inside a `ClassDeclaration` or `InterfaceDeclaration`. This method can be very useful inside of semantic lookahead. (Generallyh speaking, this kind of thing can be leveraged to solve problems that were borderline intractable in legacy JavaCC.)
